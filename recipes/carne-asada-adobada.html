        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This Mexican dish is grilled steak marinated in adobo, a flavorful mix of spices, chiles, and vinegar.  The tasty adobo is prepared with fresh ingredients and dried chiles in order to make a marinade for some thin sirloin tip steaks.  After some time on the grill, this steak is ready for a tortilla and some salsa and garnish, and ready to be enjoyed!</p>

            <li>2 whole cloves</li>
            <li>oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2-2 cups water</li>
            <li>1/4 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>

        <h4>Meal</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2-2 pounds thin sirloin tip steaks</li>
            <li>corn tortillas</li>
            <li>salsa of your choice</li>
            <li>1 cup onion diced</li>
            <li>1/3 cup cilantro chopped</li>
            <li>8 lime wedges</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a saute pan, add 1 1/2 tbsp of oil. Add the dried chiles, garlic and spices.  Spread out evenly.</li>
            <li>Toss the ingredients around slowly so they are evenly coated with oil.  After a few minutes it should start to sizzle.  Stir often for the next five minutes.</li>
            <li>Add 2 cups of water and cook for 10-12 minutes.  Remove from heat and let cool for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer all of the ingredients to the blender, including all the liquid and spices.  Add the vinegar and salt to taste.  Blend on high until very smooth.</li>
            <li>If using a regular blender, strain the sauce using a wire mesh strainer to remove unwanted chile skins and seeds.  Taste for salt and then transfer to a bowl.</li>
            <li>Divide the adobo in half.  Transfer meat to a large baking dish.  Season lightly with salt and pepper on both sides.  Take one half of the adobo and pour in 3/4 of it into pan with meat.  Toss well to coat all the meat.  Let sit for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the meat marinates for a short time, preheat your outdoor grill to medium-high heat.  When ready, drizzle oil onto meat and toss again to distribute the oil.  Transfer meat to grill and spread out evenly.</li>
            <li>Grill for 7-10 minutes, turning and rotating as needed.  Transfer to sheet pan or baking dish and cover with foil paper.  Let rest for 5 minutes.  Slice or chop to desired size for tacos.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The adobo recipe is good for up to 3 pounds of beef thinly sliced.  Freeze any leftover unused adobo for a few months.</p>
